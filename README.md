The purpose of this project was to build an interactive and insightful dashboard using Microsoft Excel to analyze diamond sales data.
We aimed to uncover patterns across price, weight, clarity, and other physical characteristics of diamonds, helping stakeholders in the diamond
retail industry make better inventory and pricing decisions.

The original dataset is usually in the dashboard file itself but I had to remove it due to file size constraints on GitHub.
However I have provided the raw dataset separately for reference.
